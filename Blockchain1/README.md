## Simple Blockchain Network

This blockchain was created using the puppeth command and setting up a genesis node that using POA.  Only two nodes were used for this example.  The geth comman was used to initialize the nodes on the genesis block.  The first node was then started and the second was bootstrapped to the first.  

Once the network was running, I was able to use MyCrypto to send a transaction from one account to the other.  

It was listed as pending so I do not know if it actually worked.  Will have to check again.
