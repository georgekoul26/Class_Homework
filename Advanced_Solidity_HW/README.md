# Crowdsale
This smart contract creates a token, PupperCoin, and then starts a crowdsale of the token.  The ERC20 token is created in the PupperCoin.sol file. The Crowdsale.sol file is the smart contract that initiates the crowdsale.  This crowdsale has a limited time and a goal that needs to be met in order to proceed.

Crowdsales like this one can become a useful way for companies to raise capital without giving up equity stakes in the company.  As the company expands, any coins minted by the company could theoretically increase in value also.
